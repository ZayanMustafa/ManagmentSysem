Workflow
Define the Database Structure:

Create tables for Admins, Teachers, Students, Courses, Classes, and Batches.
Map relationships (e.g., Teacher to Courses, Student to Classes).
Plan the Frontend Features:

Use a framework like React (since you're experienced with it).
Design role-specific dashboards (Admin, Teacher, Student).
Backend Development:

Use Node.js or Django for backend development.
Integrate REST APIs to handle CRUD operations for each module.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Firebase Authentication.
Prioritize Development:

Start with the Admin module (as it manages most data).
Develop Student and Teacher modules next.
Make Use of Frameworks:

Use libraries for styling (Material UI, Bootstrap).
Consider state management solutions like Redux for React.
Deployment and Maintenance:

Use platforms like Vercel for the frontend and Heroku for the backend.
Ensure scalability by designing APIs that handle high loads.
